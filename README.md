# IP-To-PNG-Decoder
Will automatically decode [IP-To-PNG](https://github.com/Gork3m/IP-to-PNG)

## What is IP-To-PNG
[IP-To-PNG](https://github.com/Gork3m/IP-to-PNG) converts your IPv4 address into a 4x4 2-bit PNG which you can extract the IP from, however, there is no official decoding support so you have to do it manually which is just painful hence why I made this.

## Installation
- Clone the repository.
- Install the necessary dependencies using `npm i`.

## Usage
> :warning: **Only PNG's are supported!**
```bash
node . [path to png]
```

It will automatically output the extracted IP.
